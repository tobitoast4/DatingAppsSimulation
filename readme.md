# Dating Apps Simulation

## Introduction

The idea to this [simulation](http://datingappsimulation.pythonanywhere.com/) is based on the video 
of Memeable Data: 
[Why Men Get So Few Matches on Dating Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3lypVnJ0HM). 
It tries to simulate how many matches individuals receive based on their gender and on the amount
of people of each sex in the simulation. On top, you can adjust the attractiveness formulas or both 
genders and more.
Not surprisingly, the group with the more people (in real life that's usually men) are apparently
struggling to get likes / matches on dating apps.
I highly recommend watching the mentioned video first in order to better understand 
the dynamics and moreover the results.
